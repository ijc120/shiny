NATIONAL VITAL STATISTICS SYSTEM (NVSS)
NVSS data are obtained through the CDC WONDER Online Databases. For each NVSS measure, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes used are defined below. When multiple years of data are combined and age adjusted, a non-standard population representing the midpoint of the years selected is used. This non-standard population includes all origins, races and genders.
